# Examples

This directory contains a bunch of example programs built with `cli` to show you how the library works and how you might implement common patterns.

- [Examples](#examples)
  - [`./quickstart`](#quickstart)
  - [`./subcommands`](#subcommands)

## `./quickstart`

Implements the [quickstart] command from the main project README

## `./subcommands`

A CLI with multiple subcommands, each with their own flags and expected arguments. Shows how to easily store parsed flag values in an options struct and pass them around your program.
