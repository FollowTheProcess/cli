## Project Description

`cli` is a simple, minimalist, yet functional and powerful CLI framework for Go. Inspired by things like [spf13/cobra] and [urfave/cli], but building on lessons learned and using modern Go techniques and idioms.

## Installation

```shell
go get go.followtheprocess.codes/cli@latest
```

## Quickstart

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"

    "go.followtheprocess.codes/cli"
)

func main() {
    if err := run(); err != nil {
        fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error: %v\n", err)
        os.Exit(1)
    }
}

func run() error {
    var count int
    cmd, err := cli.New(
        "quickstart",
        cli.Short("Short description of your command"),
        cli.Long("Much longer text..."),
        cli.Version("v1.2.3"),
        cli.Commit("7bcac896d5ab67edc5b58632c821ec67251da3b8"),
        cli.BuildDate("2024-08-17T10:37:30Z"),
        cli.Allow(cli.MinArgs(1)), // Must have at least one argument
        cli.Stdout(os.Stdout),
        cli.Example("Do a thing", "quickstart something"),
        cli.Example("Count the things", "quickstart something --count 3"),
        cli.Flag(&count, "count", 'c', 0, "Count the things"),
        cli.Run(runQuickstart(&count)),
    )
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }

    return cmd.Execute()
}

func runQuickstart(count *int) func(cmd *cli.Command, args []string) error {
    return func(cmd *cli.Command, args []string) error {
        fmt.Fprintf(cmd.Stdout(), "Hello from quickstart!, my args were: %v, count was %d\n", args, *count)
        return nil
    }
}
```

## Usage

### Commands

To create CLI commands, you simply call `cli.New`:

```go
cmd, err := cli.New(
    "name", // The name of your command
    cli.Short("A new command") // Shown in the help
    cli.Run(func(cmd *cli.Command, args []string) error {
        // This function is what your command does
        fmt.Printf("name called with args: %v\n", args)
        return nil
    })
)
```

> [!TIP]
> The command can be customised by applying any number of [functional options] for setting the help text, describing the arguments or flags it takes, adding subcommands etc. see <https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/FollowTheProcess/cli#Option>

### Sub Commands

To add a subcommand underneath the command you've just created, it's again `cli.New`:

```go
// Best to abstract it into a function
func buildSubcommand() (*cli.Command, error) {
    return cli.New(
        "sub", // Name of the sub command e.g. 'clone' for 'git clone'
        cli.Short("A sub command"),
        // etc..
    )
}
```

And add it to your parent command:

```go
// From the example above
cmd, err := cli.New(
    "name", // The name of your command
    // ...
    cli.SubCommands(buildSubcommand),
)
```

This pattern can be repeated recursively to create complex command structures.

### Flags

Flags in `cli` are generic, that is, there is *one* way to add a flag to your command, and that's with the `cli.Flag` option to `cli.New`

```go
type options struct {
    name string
    force bool
    size uint
    items []string
}

func buildCmd() (*cli.Command, error) {
    var opts options
    return cli.New(
        // ...
        // Signature is cli.Flag(*T, name, shorthand, default, description)
        cli.Flag(&options.name, "name", 'n', "", "The name of something"),
        cli.Flag(&options.force, "force", cli.NoShortHand, false, "Force delete without confirmation"),
        cli.Flag(&options.size, "size", 's', 0, "Size of something"),
        cli.Flag(&options.items, "items", 'i', nil, "Items to include"),
        cli.Run(runCmd(&options)), // Pass the parsed flag values to your command run function
    )
}
```

The types are all inferred automatically! No more `BoolSliceVarP` ‚ú®

The types you can use for flags currently are:

- `int`
- `int8`
- `int16`
- `int32`
- `int64`
- `uint`
- `uint8`
- `uint16`
- `uint32`
- `uint64`
- `uintptr`
- `float32`
- `float64`
- `string`
- `bool`
- `[]byte` (interpreted as a hex string)
- `Count` (special type for flags that count things e.g. a `--verbosity` flag may be used like `-vvv` to increase verbosity to 3)
- `time.Time`
- `time.Duration`
- `net.IP`
- `[]int`
- `[]int8`
- `[]int16`
- `[]int32`
- `[]int64`
- `[]uint`
- `[]uint16`
- `[]uint32`
- `[]uint64`
- `[]float32`
- `[]float64`
- `[]string`

> [!NOTE]
> You basically can't get this wrong, if you try and use an unsupported type, the Go compiler will yell at you

## Core Principles

When designing and implementing `cli`, I had some core goals and guiding principles for implementation.

### üò± Well behaved libraries don't panic

`cli` validates heavily and returns errors for you to handle. By contrast [spf13/cobra] (and by extension [spf13/pflag]) panic in a number of (IMO unnecessary) conditions including:

- Duplicate subcommand
- Command adding itself as a subcommand
- Duplicate flag
- Invalid shorthand flag letter

The design of `cli` is such that commands are instantiated with `cli.New` and a number of [functional options]. These options are in charge of configuring your command and each will perform validation prior to applying the setting.

These errors are joined and bubbled up to you in one go via `cli.New` so you don't have to play error whack-a-mole, and more importantly your application won't panic!

### üßòüèª Keep it Simple

`cli` has an intentionally small public interface and gives you only what you need to build amazing CLI apps:

- No huge structs with hundreds of fields
- No confusing or conflicting options
- Customisation in areas where it makes sense, sensible opinionated defaults everywhere else
- No reflection or struct tags

There is one and only one way to do things (and that is *usually* to use an option in `cli.New`)

### üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ Use Modern Techniques

The dominant Go CLI toolkits were mostly built many years (and many versions of Go) ago. They are reliable and battle hardened but because of their high number of users, they have had to be very conservative with changes.

`cli` has none of these constraints and can use bang up to date Go techniques and idioms.

One example is generics, consider how you define a flag:

```go
var force bool
cli.New("demo", cli.Flag(&force, "force", 'f', false, "Force something"))
```

Note the type `bool` is inferred by `cli.Flag`. This will work with any type allowed by the `Flaggable` generic constraint so you'll get compile time feedback if you've got it wrong. No more `flag.BoolStringSliceVarP` üéâ

### ü•π A Beautiful API

`cli` heavily leverages the [functional options] pattern to create a delightful experience building a CLI tool. It almost reads like plain english:

```go
var count int
cmd, err := cli.New(
    "test",
    cli.Short("Short description of your command"),
    cli.Long("Much longer text..."),
    cli.Version("v1.2.3"),
    cli.Allow(cli.MinArgs(1)),
    cli.Stdout(os.Stdout),
    cli.Example("Do a thing", "test run thing --now"),
    cli.Flag(&count, "count", 'c', 0, "Count the things"),
)
```

### üîê Immutable State

Typically, commands are implemented as a big struct with lots of fields. `cli` is no different in this regard.

What *is* different though is that this large struct can **only** be configured with `cli.New`. Once you've built your command, it can't be modified.

This eliminates a whole class of bugs and prevents misconfiguration and footguns üî´

### üöß Good Libraries are Hard to Misuse

Everything in `cli` is (hopefully) clear, intuitive, and well-documented. There's a tonne of strict validation in a bunch of places and wherever possible, misuse results in a compilation error.

Consider the following example of a bad shorthand value:

```go
var delete bool

// Note: "de" is a bad shorthand, it's two letters
cli.New("demo", cli.Flag(&delete, "delete", "de", false, "Delete something"))
```

In `cli` this is impossible as we use `rune` as the type for a flag shorthand, so the above example would not compile. Instead you must specify a valid rune:

```go
var delete bool

// Ahhh, that's better
cli.New("demo", cli.Flag(&delete, "delete", 'd', false, "Delete something"))
```

And if you don't want a shorthand? i.e. just `--delete` with no `-d` option:

```go
var delete bool
cli.New("demo", cli.Flag(&delete, "delete", cli.NoShortHand, false, "Delete something"))
```

## In the Wild

I built `cli` for my own uses really, so I've quickly adopted it across a number of tools. See the following projects for some working examples in real code:
