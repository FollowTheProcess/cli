Tiny, simple, minimal CLI framework for Go

> [!WARNING]
> **CLI is in early development and is not yet ready for use**

## Project Description

`cli` is my attempt at making a very simple, minimalist, yet functional and powerful CLI framework for Go. Inspired by things like <https://github.com/spf13/cobra> and <https://github.com/urfave/cli>.

*"So why make a new one?"*

Good question ðŸ¤”

1) I love Cobra and use it in a lot of my own programs, but IMO it's unnecessarily complex. The `Command` struct has lots of fields, has many ways to do things, and a lot of options I never use. It's a fantastic library, but has suffered from success in the sense that everybody wants it to do everything, rather than remaining tightly focussed on the essentials
2) I feel like a lot of time has passed since this was first made and now we have generics and some other cool modern Go idioms, a CLI toolkit could be better designed and have a friendlier API, with less options and one clear way to do things
3) It's fun to implement cool things from scratch and stretch your programming legs on a new problem

> [!NOTE]
> Currently flag parsing is provided by <https://github.com/spf13/pflag> (same as Cobra) while I iterate and make the overall CLI experience as nice as I can. I do plan to add my own flag parsing capability so that `cli` is a completely self contained toolkit.

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/FollowTheProcess/cli@latest
